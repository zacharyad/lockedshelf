  {
    question: 'Is there a way to get hints?',
    answer:
      "Yes, there's a \"hint toggle\" button on the book's answer entry page. It reveals additional clues for puzzles that you've attempted more than 5 times. If you find a puzzle too difficult, you can use the hints. We don't keep track of the hint button's use, so it's on the honor system if you're competing with friends or family.",
